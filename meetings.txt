First meeting
	Monday: 14/07/2025
	Time: 12:30 pm
	Attend: Nancy Ballou
	Goal : 
		1. Get to know each other
		2. Ask if there is any tech related issue that they are currently facing and if it can be solved by making or implementing a software.
Second Meeting
	Monday:21/07/2025
	Time: 4:30 pm
	Attend: Kelsey Langdale and Nancy Ballou
	Goal: 
		- See how can we leverage Apollo to get complete information about companies we are interested in. 
		- What solutions can I bring:
			- I will present my idea of me bringing software solutions so that the process of acquiring complete data becomes fast in the future. 
		My progress on this topic: 
			- I was able to build a python script that makes an API call to Apollo and retrieves info that's missing. The script would go over a csv file that is provided to me and determine what's missing and retrieve info accordingly. 
			- However, when I was about to make an API key for Apollo, I found out that Pipewire was one of the integrations already present in the account that was given to me. This points out to the possibility that the csv file that was provided to me was created by Pipewire using Apollo's database. Hence, I won't be able to retrieve any additional data from making API calls to Apollo. 
			- Came across this site called OctoParse. Let's see if that works. 
	During meeting: 
		- We talked about how PipeDrive might be using Apollo's database.
		- Instead of moving forward with the already generated list, we decided to make a new list based on filters that will be sent to me. 
		- Kelsey was curious if I could come up with a software solution for an issue they have been facing. The issue being that, different vendors communicate to them via. different modes of communciation such as WhatsApp, email, etc and having to convert all that data into a format taht pipedrive accepts is tedious. 
		- I proposed a software solutiuon such that data from different formats is converted into one pre-determined format.
			- I informed them that I will need until coming Friday to determine all the information I need from them and the technology I will be using to solve this issue, to which they agreed.
		- We also agreed on having a recurring meeting every Tuesday @4:30pm. 

After our second meeting: 
	- Nancy reached out to me and requested for a program that could help them enrich data on list of people they already have. 
	- This program was their top priority so instead of making the prpgram that helps convert different file format into one, I will be working on this one.

Third Meeting: 
	Tuesday:29/07/2025
	Time: 4:30 pm
	Attend: Kelsey Langdale and Nancy Ballou
	Goal: 
		- Live demo the data enrichment script that I wrote. 
		- Talk about my future plans with the script. 
		- The documentation processs. 
	During meeting: 
		- Did the live demo (got feedback -> recorded in the project progress file). 
		- We went back to talking about the program that would help convert different file formats(not what extension they have but how are they written, for eg: tables, brochures, catalouge, etc.) into a format that can be used to feed into a PipDrive. 
		- Also talked a little about making a post in LinkedIn.
		- How to customize Apollo such that the recommendations it gives are more suited to our organization. 
		- An app that tracks live updates made to an excel sheet and sends an email when it detects an update -> I am going to call it Tereo (Greek: To watch). 
		- Also updated Nancy and Kelsey regarding my moving plans coming weekend which might extend to next week. 
	To do: 
		- Work on the coversion program. I am going to call it Henos(Greek: One)
